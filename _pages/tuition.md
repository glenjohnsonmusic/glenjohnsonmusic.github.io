In addition to my busy playing career, I offer individual lessons on Saxophone, Clarinet and Flute, and in Music Theory in Dunmow, Essex; East Hertfordshire and East London.  I am also able to offer tutoring for GCSE and A-level Music and Music Technology courses for individuals or small groups.

My fundamental belief with regard to music education is that it should be a fun, enjoyable and rewarding experience.  With this aim in mind, I strive to develop an approach tailored towards each student, taking account of their experience level, their personal musical goals and their own musical interests and tastes.  I am equally at home teaching Jazz, Pop, Soul or the ever-expanding repertoire of classical saxophone music.

I have a wealth of experience in music education, teaching adults and young people in a wide variety of settings and contexts.  In addition to having been an instrumental tutor since 1999: I have a Post Graduate Certificate in Education and have spent several years as a head of music in state secondary schools and at a 6th Form College; have taught and examined A-level courses in Music and Music Technology; have directed various ensembles within educational establishments and have devised and delivered workshops with a focus upon jazz and improvisation.

My students have a 100% pass rate in their ABRSM practical and theory exams, with many attaining Merit and Distinction passes (including at grade 8).

I have an advanced CRB check and am happy to provide testimonials upon request.
