    <p>Throughout his career as a professional saxophonist, Glen has continually refined his skills as an instrumentalist, arranger, recording engineer and Musical Director, establishing a reputation as a versatile, dynamic and highly professional musician, leading to regular work with international artists, both live and in the studio.</p>
    <p>Born in East London, Glen began playing the saxophone at the age of 12, later adding further woodwind instruments to his arsenal, in addition to guitar, bass and various tuned and untuned percussion.</p>
    <p>Glen's saxophone studies immediately led him in the direction of the jazz greats such as Charlie Parker, Sonny Rollins and John Coltrane, amongst others, but his studies under Lyn Dobson (Nick Drake; John Martyn; The Soft Machine etc) deepened his understanding of the instrument's role in rock, folk and various traditional musical styles from around the world, an education which continued at Middlesex University, studying with several luminaries of the British Jazz scene.</p>
    <p>Playing professionally since his late teens, Glen has been fortunate enough to work in a wide variety of styles, with many high profile artists, including Rock & Roll with Chubby Checker; Funk with Nik West (Prince; Quincy Jones), Jazz Fusion with Rabih Abou Khalil and various pop acts, to name but a few.  This varied playing career has afforded Glen the opportunity to travel extensively, playing at prestigious venues across the U.K and Europe, from Ska in Germany at the Freedom Sounds Festival; a headline slot at the Umbria Jazz Festival; the Lyric Theatre in London's West End, and countless stages large and small everywhere in-between.</p>
    <p>Currently working on two successful touring theatre shows, alongside both on location and remote recording sessions, Glen is available for live and studio session work, horn section arrangements and teaching (face-to-face or online).</p>
